<p>The previous website for Wollongong City Council was powered by a legacy system that had been maintained for almost fifteen years by 2019. The website was outdated, not responsive and users reported that it was difficult to find the information that they needed. It was in my capacity as project coordinator, business analyst and UI/UX designer that the Council was able to consult with the community (i.e. users) and external digital strategists and platform providers to redevelop this website from scratch.</p>

<p>Changes made from the old to the new website include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>(Finally) utilising responsive web design.</li>
<li>Implementing a new CMS (Matrix by Squiz).</li>
<li>A splash page that enables the user to choose a profile for themselves (whether they're a resident, business owner or tourist) which brings to the forefront the most relevant content first.</li>
</ul>
