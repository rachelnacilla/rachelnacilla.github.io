<p>In 2013, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan" target="_blank">Typhoon Haiyan</a>, a category 5 typhoon, made landfall in eastern Philippines. It was the deadliest typhoon on record at the time that caused mass destruction in the islands of Leyte and Samar.</p>

<p><em>Providing Hope for the Philippines</em> was a charity event held in Wollongong, NSW in December 2013. As a member of the organising committee, I created an infographic to encourage the community to make a donation to aid in ongoing relief efforts. In the end, over $6,000 in total was raised that night, with proceeds going towards humanitarian aid.</p>
