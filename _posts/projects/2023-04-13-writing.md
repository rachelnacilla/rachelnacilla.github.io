<p>I keep a very occassional blog on Medium, which I have been writing in since 2016, towards the early part of my technical career. The intent is to start writing here again now that I have progressed further, and my career these days looks a little different to when I was working as an analyst programmer.</p>

<p>I write about programming, leadership, data, technology, my volunteering work and my personal career journey.</p>
