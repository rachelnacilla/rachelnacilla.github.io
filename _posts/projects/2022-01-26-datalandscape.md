<p>Exploring the Modern Data Landscape was a presentation I gave in May 2021 at the inaugural meetup for Siligong.Data, part of <a href="https://www.siligongvalley.com/" target="_blank">Siligong Valley</a>. In attendance at the event were data professionals from all different backgrounds, including data scientists, software engineers, business analysts and marketing professionals. This presentation, as the first talk of the session, was designed to give everyone in the room a crash course on data and how it is used today in tech. </p>
