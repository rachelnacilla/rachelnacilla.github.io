<p>At the University of Wollongong, I managed and allocated compute time on Gadi, the university's high performance computing cluster at the <a href="https://nci.org.au" target="_blank">NCI</a>, to scientific researchers. When I began doing this, the method of collecting this data was not centralised (i.e. the process involved dealing with multiple Excel spreadsheets and manual calculations).</p>

<p>To make the management process more efficient and user-friendly, I designed a more robust data management solution in <a href="https://projectredcap.org/software/" target="_blank">REDCap</a> that is centralised at one location, keeping in mind data integrity and more accurate data collection. After implementing this new solution, I could track how much compute time was allocated to each researcher and their compute time utilisation for the quarter, which I would then report to the steering committee.</p>

<p>This new solution reduced the time spent managing HPC resources by 29%. Since then, compute time resource management became much easier with minimal errors made.</p>
