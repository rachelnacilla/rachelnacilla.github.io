<p>The University of Wollongong (UOW) offers partner share access to Gadi, Australia's fastest supercomputer, as part of the National Computational Infrastructure Collaboration Agreement. It serves as UOW's high performance computational cluster.</p>

<p>I was responsible for managing and allocating high performance computing resources (i.e. compute time) to scientific researchers as part of this agreement. To make the administrative and application process more efficient and user-friendly, I designed a more robust data management solution in <a href="https://projectredcap.org/software/" target="_blank">REDCap</a> that is centralised at one location, keeping in mind data integrity and more accurate data collection. After implementing this new solution, I could track how much compute time was allocated to each researcher and their compute time utilisation for the quarter, which I would then report to the steering committee.</p>

<p>This new solution reduced the time spent managing HPC resources by 29%. Since then, compute time resource management became much easier with minimal errors made.</p>
